In _The Individuation of the Powers of the Soul_ I focus on early modern discussions of the individuation of psychological powers—such as sense perception, thought, and desire. The motivating philosophical puzzle in these discussions is this: It easily seems to us that, for example, seeing a tree is something different from smelling tree, and that both in turn differ from thinking of a tree. But in virtue of what are these capacities of seeing, smelling and thinking different? Are they really distinct at all? In this research I give five case studies of how authors in the early modern period struggle with these and related puzzles. Overall, I establish how changes in metaphysics, as opposed to changes in epistemology or the account of psychological processing, drive the way in which authors in this period distinguish the powers of the mind.

In the first essay, ‘**Extended Souls**’, I assess how, if at all, the body matters for divisions of psychological powers. Focusing on the work of Cambridge Platonists, including Anne Conway (1631-1679) and Henry More (1614-1687), I detail a tension between two commitments: (1) that the soul is simple and present in all of body as an undivided whole; (2) that the soul operates differently in, say, the tongue than it does in the eye; in short, that the soul performs a variety of processes. I show how novel conceptions of the relation between extension and immateriality help mitigate this tension. Collectively, they undermine arguments for distinctions between powers based on bodily location.

Does what I can think about matter for distinctions between mental powers? In the second essay, ‘**Unity by Content**’, I discuss the medieval claim that, to account for the possibility of universally shared intellectual thought, we must conclude that the whole of humanity shares one single intellect. Here I bring out how seventeenth century authors such as Pierre Gassendi avoided this conclusion. I argue that it is not so much because of new explanations of universal thought, such as the possibility of abstraction or innate notions. Rather, a new framework of individuation allows them to sidestep a collapse of all human intellects into one.

The third essay is one of two focusing on specific domains of psychology. In ‘**Unifying the Inner Senses: Suárez’s _De Anima_**', I discuss Francisco Suárez’s (1548-1617) account of an elusive psychological category, namely that of ‘inner sense powers’, common examples of which include imagination and memory. I argue that Suárez’s radical claim that there is just one inner sense is explained by two factors: his novel application a familiar principle of individuation, and his restriction of what counts as an object of inner sense cognition. Suárez’s work exemplifies a tendency toward a more unified conception of the mind.

In the fourth essay, ‘**Cartesian Evaluative Perception**’, I show how the boundaries between the domains of perception and evaluation can sometimes be fluid. I focus on Descartes’s writings from the 1640s. I argue that Descartes avoids the popular medieval claim that we have a primitive, distinct psychological capacity to apprehend the evaluative features of a thing. Descartes’s alternative model enables him to do two things: (1) to do away with irreducibly distinct psychological powers, by placing evaluative responses firmly in standard perception; (2) to say how evaluative cognition can be correct, without appealing to the transfer of properties.

Do our capacities for perceiving and thinking differ strictly, or only in degree? In the fifth essay, ‘**Gradual Perceptual Difference**’, I address this question for Leibniz’s work from the 1680s. I argue that Leibniz did not take differences in forms of cognition as primitive. Rather, he adopts a version of the common scholastic principle that differences in cognition follow upon differences in the constitution of a creature—more specifically, their degree of ‘prime matter’. It lands Leibniz with model on which cognitive capacities differ only gradually.
