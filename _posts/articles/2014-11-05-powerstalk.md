Can powers actualize? In my talk 'The Relation Between a Power and Its Acts' on November 28 at the University of Toronto I'll tell you all about it. Here is the abstract:

> Recent debates in epistemology, philosophy of action and metaphysics have shown fresh enthusiasm for the idea that powers are causally responsible for acts of seeing, hearing, doing and knowing. But a central question has gone unexamined throughout these debates. What is the relation between a power and the act it brings about? In this paper I first assess the answer to that question for standard type-pluralist models, and argue that they run into either a contradiction or a regress. Secondly, I focus on less common one-to-one models, and show that the only one of these that metaphysically works turns out to be explanatorily void. I conclude that any appeal to powers in these debates should halt until we get clear on the relation between a power and its act.
