Potentiality, actuality, possibility, impossibility, necessity — we will be hearing a lot of it at this year’s annual [British Society for the History of Philosophy conference on The Actual and The Possible](http://actualpossibleconference.wordpress.com/), to be held at University of York on 16-18 April 2013.

On April 17th, I will present a paper on how Francisco Suárez (1548-1617) in his *Metaphysical Disputations* uses a specific understanding of what it is to be actual or potential to attack the idea that there is a distinction between a thing’s essence and its existence.
