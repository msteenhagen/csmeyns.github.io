What happened to Aristotle’s *Metaphysics* after the author had placed down his stylus? On May 20-21, 2013, the Munich School of Ancient Philosophy (MUSAΦ) of the Ludwig-Maxilimiäns-Universität München hosts a seminar to answer this question, insofar as it concern the Arabic tradition. See: [*The Arabic Version of the Metaphysics*](http://www.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/aktuelles/arabic-version-of-metaphysics/index.html).
