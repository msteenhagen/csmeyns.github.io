The Society for Ancient Greek Philosophy (SAGP) and the Society for the Study of Islamic Philosophy and Science (SSIPS) will hold their Annual Joint Meeting on October 11-13 this year at Fordham University. I will be chairing the session on Medieval Logic, and give a paper on ‘The Unity of Inner Sense Powers: Avicenna and Suárez’ in the Medieval Epistemology session. Full program here (pdf).
