At the upcoming 2014 APA Pacific Division Meeting, I’ll be giving the paper ‘Descartes Against Estimation’, on Descartes’s transformation of a prominent account of primitive evaluative cognition. Alex S. Kohav from MSU Denver will be the commentator for this paper.

The paper is part of a session of the newly founded Descartes Society, initiated by Roger Florka (Ursinus College). Here’s the full program for that session:
