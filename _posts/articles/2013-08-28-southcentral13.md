This month I will be giving a paper on ‘Suárez on the Unity of Inner Sense Power’ at the South Central Seminar in the History of Early Modern Philosophy, held from September 27-28, 2013 at Texas A&M University. It’s an exciting line-up, with quite some talks on topics in the philosophy of mind and psychology of the Big Seven. [Here’s the full program](http://philosophy.tamu.edu/~sdaniel/seminar13.html).
