Two exciting events at Yale this week for Leibniz scholars. First, from October 18-20, there will be the Seventh Annual Conference of the [Leibniz Society of North America](http://www.gwleibniz.com/). Talks cover topics ranging from evil to infinity, as well as a standing interest of mine: faculty psychology and the powers of the soul. Here is the full program. 

Second, on October 22 the Society for Early Modern Philosophy at Yale (SEMPY) will host a talk by [Christian Barth](https://www.philosophie.hu-berlin.de/institut/lehrbereiche/theorie/mitarbeiter/barth) (HU Berlin), on ‘Leibniz on Phenomenal Consciousness’, for which I will be the respondent. [More details here](http://calendar.yale.edu/cal/philosophy/month/20131018/All/CAL-2c9cb3cd-3fcdb25c-0140-39f67991-00007587bedework@yale.edu/).
