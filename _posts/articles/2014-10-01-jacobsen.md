I am thrilled to have been awarded a [Royal Institute of Philosophy](http://royalinstitutephilosophy.org) Jacobsen Fellowship 2014-15 for my work in early modern philosophy of psychology. 

My research project this year is on the individuation of psychological powers, such as sense perception, memory, thought and desire. Do authors such as Descartes, Su√°rez, and Leibniz take these capacities to be distinct from one another, and if so, how? I'll report on the findings by 2015.
