As Descartes knew, philosophers need to reflect on their methodology sometimes. This indeed we will do. On May 16 the [Edinburgh Women in Philosophy Group](http://www.ppls.ed.ac.uk/philosophy/groups/edinburgh-women-in-philosophy-group) hosts its annual Spring Workshop, which this year focuses on Philosophical Methodology.

Speakers are:

- [Catarina Dutilh Novaes](https://sites.google.com/site/catarinadutilhnovaes/) (Groningen)
- [Amia Srinivasan](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~corp1468/Welcome.html) (Oxford)
- [Nancy Bauer](http://ase.tufts.edu/philosophy/faculty/bauer.asp) (Tufts)
- [Eric Schliesser](http://www.sarton.ugent.be/node/14) (Ghent)

I will give a response to Amia Srinivasan’s paper, ‘Does Feminist Philosophy Rest on a Mistake?’
