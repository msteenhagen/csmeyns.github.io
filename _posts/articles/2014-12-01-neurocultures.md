I recently joined the interdisciplinary [Exploring Neuroculture](http://www.humanities.utoronto.ca/WG14-15_exploring_neuroculture) working group at the [Jackman Humanities Institute](http://www.humanities.utoronto.ca), University of Toronto. The aim of the group is to study the expanding appeal to neuroscientific findings in wider culture, from law and literature to history and education.
