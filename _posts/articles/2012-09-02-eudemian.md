Proceedings of the S.V. Keeling Memorial Colloquium 2005, _[The Eudemian Ethics on the Voluntary, Friendship, and Luck](http://www.brill.com/eudemian-ethics-voluntary-friendship-and-luck)_, edited by Fiona Leigh (UCL), are now out at BRILL publishers. From the website:

>“Reflecting the relatively recent high level of scholarly interest in Aristotle’s *Eudemian Ethics* (EE), each paper in this collection is concerned first and foremost to understand the arguments from the EE it examines in terms of that work alone. The papers, by David Charles, Christopher Rowe, M.M. McCabe, Jennifer Whiting, and Friedemann Buddensiek, focus variously on the topics of the voluntary, friendship and luck, only drawing on other texts in the service of illuminating the EE. The result is a volume containing novel, at times even conflicting, readings of questions central to understanding this important text and Aristotle’s ethics in general.”
