Twenty-seven years since its inception, the [Ancient Commentators on Aristotle project](http://www.ancientcommentators.org.uk/), lead by Richard Sorabji, has published its hundredth volume (to be precise: [*‘Simplicius’ On Aristotle-On-the-Soul-3.6-13*](http://www.bloomsburyacademic.com/view/Simplicius-On-Aristotle-On-the-Soul-3.6-13/book-ba-9781780932910.xml), translated by Carlos Steel), with still more volumes scheduled to be published. This asks for a celebration.

From Tuesday 4 until Friday 7 December 2012, the Institute of Philosophy and KCL in London and Wolfson College, Oxford, will transform into hubs of scholarship on late ancient and medieval commenting on Aristotle and, admittedly, also Plato.
