I’m a philosopher at University College London (UCL). In my work I focus on metaphysics and philosophy of psychology, both in historical and contemporary debates. In particular, I am fascinated by discussions in the early modern and late medieval period: they exhibit a deep rethinking of and radical continuities in the most fundamental metaphysical and psychological categories.

I have worked on imagination, essence and existence, distinction and explanation, and psychological essentialism. My doctoral research concentrates on early modern and late medieval accounts of distinctions between powers of the soul—for example, between sense, intellect, and memory.
