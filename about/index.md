I am a researcher in philosophy at <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/philosophy" target="_blank">University College London</a>. In the 2014/15 academic year I hold a Visiting Research position at the <a href="http://www.philosophy.utoronto.ca" target="_blank">University of Toronto</a>. My work is in metaphysics, philosophy of psychology, and early modern philosophy. Prior to joining London and Toronto, I held visiting positions at <a href="http://philosophy.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Yale University</a> and <a href="http://www.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/index.html" target="_blank">LMU Munich</a>. A copy of my CV can be found 
<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14527061/meyns_CV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

My current research project, [The Individuation of the Powers of the Soul](/media/ips), concentrates on early modern accounts of psychological capacities, such as sense perception, thought, and memory. In addition, I have worked on imagination, plasticity, distinction and explanation, and psychological essentialism.
