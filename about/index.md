I'm a philosopher at [University College London](www.ucl.ac.uk/philosophy), and in 2014/15 I hold a Visiting Research position in philosophy at the [University of Toronto](www.philosophy.utoronto.ca). My work focuses on metaphysics and philosophy of psychology, and both in contemporary and historical debates. In particular, I study discussions in the early modern and late medieval period, which exhibit a deep rethinking of and radical continuities in the most fundamental metaphysical and psychological categories.

I have worked on imagination, essence and existence, distinction and explanation, and psychological essentialism. My doctoral research concentrates on early modern and late medieval accounts of distinctions between powers of the soul—for example, between sense, intellect, and memory.
